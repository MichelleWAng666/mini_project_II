# Miniproject 2

### [Assignment](assignment.md)



## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
1, It is a real case to compare two data from two compay about POIs in bars and resturants.
2, To combine and practice what we learn in thses two weeks, eg, APIS, SQL, Pandas, JSON.


## Process
### (your step 1)
Firstly, get the API keys and Api to get into the data. The most difficult things is to find the right link and format, most in understand the document of APIs. And, in the first step, I also need to understand the app to back to rral life. Foursquare in vancouer, do not having rating, i struggle for few hours to figure out this trouble. But, in reality, we do not even use it. 
### (your step 2)
After get the data, I was trying to understand the Data. It takes a while. Then, using pnadas to analysis it. This step is smoothly, but to figure the bugs takes more time for me. 

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area)
For quantity of the resturantss and bar, the yelp covers more, in 20 stores. For Foursquare, it only have 6. For the area, Foursquare have surrey , vacouver, west vancouver, and Saanichton. But, in yelp, they only have the store on vancouver. For now, both of them do not have enough coverage.

For POIs, the Yelp gives more rating and count_reviews information, but , for fourdquare, they do not have this information. 

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
1, Find the right APIs
2, Find the errors 
3, Always confuse about the questions
4, Need more practice on coding

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I have more time, I gonna find more data to compare. For example, the googless etc> The similar data to get more data find more things. For me, i still did not very familiar about the code, and combie all togther. Get more details on these data. And, more time to make charts ,digrams and the results different with other people.
